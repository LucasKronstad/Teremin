# Theremin

## What it does
This is an arduino UNO version of a theremin.
A theremin is an instrument played with your hands or any other object by moving it further or closer to a sensor.
Moving closer to the sensor results in a higher pitch and moving away from it creates a lower pitch.
Therefore you can create different notes and play music in floating air.

## How it works
My version uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to determine if an object is in front of the sensor and correlates to a frequency.
