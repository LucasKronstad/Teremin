# Theremin
This is an arduino theremin.
A theremin is an instrument played with you hands in the air.
This version is done via 2 ultrasonic distance sensors where one sensor controls the volume and the other the frequency.
You change volume and frequency by moving you hands closer or further away from the sensors.
